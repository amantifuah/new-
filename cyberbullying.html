        <h3>Signs and effects</h3>
        <p>
         Cyberbullying can appear in many different ways:</br>
        Posting rumors or mean messages about you on social media.</br>
        Creating mean memes or shareable content about you without your permission.</br>
       Sending or leaving unwanted explicit messages, images, or comments.</br>
       Going behind your back in your social circle online.</br>
       Generally, cyberbullying effects can be classified under the following:</br>
       Psychological effects – low self-esteem, isolation and withdrawal, harmful habits</br>
      Physical effects – headaches, stomach aches, sleeping problems</br>
      Mental effects – anxiety, loss of concentration, self-harm, suicidal thoughts</br>
      Emotional effects – depression, shame, guilt, embarrassment

        <h3><span>Report / block</span> accounts</h3>
        <p>
          While cyberbullying is often framed as an issue for children, anyone can be a victim.
           When it comes to the bullies of the 2020s, social media is now the unsupervised playground for us all.
           We recommend that you just block them – there's no need to give them more of your time and energy.
           Every platform has simple ways you can block and report users engaged in bullying behavior.
            There's no shame in having a strong blocking game!
