        <h2>What are <span>scams?</span></h2>
        <p>
         Scams are illegal, deceptive schemes where criminals trick people into giving away money,
          personal information, or valuable data by creating fake, urgent, or too-good-to-be-true situations,
           often impersonating legitimate organizations or using fear tactics to pressure victims into acting quickly.
            They exploit trust and emotion, using technology like fake emails (phishing), texts, or phone calls,
             and can range from simple confidence tricks to sophisticated operations.

         Impersonation:Typically, scammers pretend to be from a well-known trusted business, 
         government department or organisation and they threaten you into handing over your money or personal details.</br>
         Phishing: is a way that cybercriminals steal confidential information such as online banking logins,
          credit card details, business login credentials or passwords/passphrases.
        They do this by sending fraudulent messages and emails (sometimes called ‘lures’).</br>
          Charity:Some scammers will contact you via phone, mail, email or face-to-face and pretend to be a charity.
           Often these messages will look like they real thing, but then they will ask you to click on a link,
            make a payment or provide personal information.
