      <h3>1. Not sharing info</h3>
      <p>
        Be cautious about how much personal information you provide on social networking sites.
         The more information you post, the easier it may be for a hacker or someone else to use that information to steal your identity, access your data or commit other crimes such as stalking.
         Also, think about who can see your social media musings, most platforms allow you to limit who can see or engage with your posts if you don't know the whole world to know your business.

        <h3>2. Strong password</h3>
        <p>
         Use a unique password that includes 8 to 12 letters, numbers, and symbols for each one of your social media accounts.
          Don’t repeat passwords and be sure to change your passwords regularly. You can also use a password manager,
           which will notify you if any stored login information is comprised.

      <h3>3. Avoid clickjacking</h3>
      <p>
        Clickjacking is the practice of sending an enticing email or tweet that contains a hyperlinked URL which when clicked on takes you to a site that either prompts you to log in or dumps a virus as you land on it.
          Often Twitter accounts that have been hijacked (hacked) start sending out the clickjacking messages to their followers.
           The best thing to do if you fall prey to clickjacking is to change your password and make sure it is a strong one.

        <h3>4. Handling fake accounts</h3>
        <p>
          Scammers will make fake accounts and/or hack real accounts to use them to commit a range of fraudulent activities.
           Many sites have a process to verify accounts, such as verified badges for Instagram and Facebook.
           Things to look out for include:

           the date an account was set up, 
            nonsensical names (appears to be random letters and numbers), 
            the number of followers (although note that followers can be bought).
            If a family member or friend posts something that appears suspicious or out of character,
             contact them by another method (in case their account has been hacked).
             You can also report fake posts or accounts directly with the provider.
